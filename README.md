# Bug Bounty Free Resources 
Introduction

What is a bug?

Security bug or vulnerability is “a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, OR availability.
What is Bug Bounty?

A bug bounty or bug bounty program is IT jargon for a reward or bounty program given for finding and reporting a bug in a particular software product. Many IT companies offer bug bounties to drive product improvement and get more interaction from end users or clients. Companies that operate bug bounty programs may get hundreds of bug reports, including security bugs and security vulnerabilities, and many who report those bugs stand to receive awards.

What is the Reward?

There are all types of rewards based on the severity of the issue and the cost to fix. They may range from real money (most prevalent) to premium subscriptions (Prime/Netflix), discount coupons (for e commerce of shopping sites), gift vouchers, swags (apparels, badges, customized stationery, etc.). Money may range from 50$ to 50,000$ and even more.

Bug Bounty Report Format
Title

The first impression is the last impression, the security engineer looks at the title first and he should be able to identify the issue.

Include the Impact of the issue in the title if possible.
Description

This component provides details of the vulnerability, you can explain the vulnerability here, write about the paths, endpoints, error messages you got while testing. You can also attach HTTP requests, vulnerable source code.
Steps to Reproduce

Write the stepwise process to recreate the bug. It is important for an app owner to be able to verify what you've found and understand the scenario.
You must write each step clearly in-order to demonstrate the issue. that helps security engineers to triage fast.
Proof of Concept

This component is the visual of the whole work. You can record a demonstration video or attach screenshots.
Impact

Write about the real-life impact, How an attacker can take advantage if he/she successfully exploits the vulnerability.
What type of possible damages could be done? (avoid writing about the theoretical impact)
Should align with the business objective of the organization
